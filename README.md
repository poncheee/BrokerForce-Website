## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (optional - will be installed automatically if Homebrew is available)
- Google OAuth credentials (for authentication)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd BrokerForce-Website-1
   ```

2. **Run the complete setup script:**

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   This single script will:

   - ✅ Install all dependencies (pnpm, npm packages)
   - ✅ Set up environment files
   - ✅ Install and configure PostgreSQL (if Homebrew available)
   - ✅ Create database and initialize schema
   - ✅ Configure all necessary settings

3. **Configure Google OAuth** (required for login):

   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
   - Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3001/auth/google/callback`
   - Update `google-login-demo/.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
     ```

4. **Start development servers:**

   ```bash
   ./start-servers.sh
   ```

   This will start:

   - 📱 **Frontend**: `http://localhost:5173` (React/Vite)
   - 🔐 **Backend**: `http://localhost:3001` (Auth server)
